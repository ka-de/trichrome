Designed by our expert token ticklers from Germany üá©üá™, trichrome offers extensive customizable options, even down to the article!

```python
# Define possible species with their corresponding weights
species = [
    ("wolf", 5),
    ("üê∫", 1)
]

# Randomly choose whether to include an article ("a," "an") or nothing
article_choice = random.choice(["a", "an", ""])
```

## Usage

To use Trichrome, simply run the script in your terminal or code editor. It will provide you with a creatively crafted prompt that you can use as a starting point for your work. You can also customize the prompts to match your preferences and project requirements.

Here's an example of how to run Trichrome:
```bash
%HOME%\python.exe -m venv %VIRTUAL_ENV%\wtf\vendor\python3\python3.exe art.py
```

Trichrome is a term often used in the world of color and art. In real life, it refers to a color printing process that utilizes three primary ink colors (usually cyan, magenta, and yellow) to produce a wide range of colors by varying their intensity and overlapping them. This process is commonly used in color printing to create vibrant and detailed images. We have nothing to do with that tho.
